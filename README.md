A simple web page created to understand and visualize the **CSS Box Model** (Padding, Border, and Margin).

## 🚀 About the Project
This project was built as a learning exercise to see how internal spacing (padding) and external spacing (margin) affect the layout of an element. It features:
*   A dark-themed interface.
*   Centered text and rounded borders.
*   Clear visualization of the box components.

## 🛠️ Built With
*   **HTML5** - Structure of the page.
*   **CSS3** - Styling and Box Model implementation.

## 🧠 What I Learned
*   How `padding` creates space inside the border.
*   Using `border-radius` for smooth corners.
*   The difference between `margin` (outside) and `padding` (inside).
*   Centering elements using `text-align`.
